### 📧 Email Configuration
For email functionality to work properly, configure an SMTP provider:

#### For Mail.ru (recommended for Russian users):
1. Log in to your Mail.ru account.
2. Go to Settings → Security → App passwords.
3. Generate a new app password.
4. Use this password in your `.env` file as `PASSWORD`.

#### For Gmail:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account.
2. Generate an app password at [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
3. Use the generated password in your `.env` file.
4. Update `MAIL_SERVER` to `smtp.gmail.com`.

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Redis server
- SMTP email account (Gmail, Mail.ru, etc.)
- Node.js (version 14.x or higher recommended)

#### Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository and checkout on stable local version:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iwlj4s/BookReviews.git
   cd BookReviews
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -t origin/local-stable-version
   git checkout local-stable-version
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv .venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       .venv\Scripts\Activate
       ```
     - macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:
     ```bash
     DB_LITE="sqlite+aiosqlite:///BookReviews.db"
     DB_LITE_FOR_ALEMBIC="sqlite:///BookReviews.db"
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
     ALGORITHM=HS256
     LOGIN="your_email@mail.ru"
     PASSWORD=your_app_password
     ```

4. **Start Redis server:**
   - Download and run Redis from Redis Installation Guide (for Windows).
   - For macOS:
     ```bash
     brew install redis
     brew services start redis
     ```
   - For Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install redis-server
     sudo systemctl start redis
     ```

#### Run the Backend Application
- Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  uvicorn backend.src.main:app --reload
  ```

#### Run the Celery Worker
- Open another terminal and run:
  ```bash
  celery -A backend.celery.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
  ```

#### Swagger docs:
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### Setting Up the Frontend
1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Node.js (version 14.x or higher) installed. Check your Node.js version:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

   If you need to install or update Node.js, refer to the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version.

   Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Backend:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- **Frontend:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting
#### Common Issues
- **Celery authentication errors:** Ensure you're using an app password, not your regular email password. Verify SMTP settings in your `.env` file.
- **Redis connection issues:** Make sure Redis server is running: `redis-cli ping` should return "PONG".
